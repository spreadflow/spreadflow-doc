Intro
=====

SpreadFlow is a metadata extraction and processing engine. Its main purpose is
to support file based media production workflows by observing changes to text
and media files in real-time.

Information gathered through this process can be used to transform and
recombine content, e.g., in order to prepare it for different publishing
channels.
